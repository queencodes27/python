PEP 8 - PYTHON ENHANCEMENT PROPOSAL
It is a documentation which is used for best practices of Python and written by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, Nick Coghlan
It is a guideline.
It improves readibility of python code
It shows professionalist of your work if you commented well and use necessary whitespaces as well structure your code well.

function: use lowercase word or words. separate words by underscore __
 ex: function, my_function

variable : use lowercase letter, word, words. separate with underscore
ex: x, var, my_variable

Class: start with capital letter. the style called camel case or pascal case
ex : Model, MyClass

Method: use lowercase word and words 
ex: class_method, method

Constant: Use an uppercase single letter, word, or words
ex: CONSTANT, MY_CONSTANT, MY_LONG_CONSTANT

Module: use short words to name your files. 
ex: myclass.py, function.my_function

Package: use lowercase word
ex: package, mypackage

PEP 8 suggests lines should be limited to 79 characters. This is because it allows you to have multiple files open next to one another, while also avoiding line wrapping
# Recommended
total = (first_variable
         + second_variable
         - third_variable)

# Not Recommended
total = (first_variable +
         second_variable -
         third_variable)

How to check python version?


inline commenting;
Use .startswith() and .endswith() instead of slicing. If you were trying to check if a string word was prefixed, or suffixed, with the word cat, 
it might seem sensible to use list slicing.

However, list slicing is prone to error, and you have to hardcode the number of characters in the prefix or suffix. It is also not clear to someone less familiar with Python 
list slicing what you are trying to achieve
