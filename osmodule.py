Python OS module provides easy functions that allow us to interact and
get Operating System information and even control processes up to a limit.

import os
from datetime 
print(os.getcwd()) : prints current working dir
print(os.listdir()) : prints  list of dir 
os.mkdir
os.stat : this prints out information about the file such as st.mtime, st.
os.walk()
